# Plan My Trip with Python APIs

## Overview of Project
As a new data analyst at PyBer, a ridesharing company, you are tasked with making visualizations using pandas in conjunction with matplotlib to create a line graph with multiple lines to display the variations in fares between rural, suburban and urban cities. To make this line graph you will be using fare data at the weekly level for each city type.

## Results

### Total Fares by Month/Week
The results of analysis revealed that on a weekly basis between January 2019 and the end of April 2019 urban cities made the most fares. Urban cities were always above $1,500. Whereas Suburban cities stayed between $500 and $1,500  and rural cities stayed under $500. Meaning that urban cities earn at least three times the amount of fares in the same time period as rural cities. This can be see in greater detail in the graph below.

## Summary
Based on the results, the following recommendations are made to solve disparities:

1. Try to increase both riders and drivers in suburban cities.
2. Reduce the number of drivers in urban areas to try to increase the Average Fare per Driver for urban cities.
3. Increase the number of drivers in rural cities If the drivers didn't have to travel as far or the customers have to wait so long, maybe there would be higher utilization.
