# Plan My Trip with Python APIs

## Overview of Project
The head of the user interface team (Jack) at Plan My Trip, a hotel travel website has asked company XYZ for help in creating a search page that uses filter criteria to determine the customers' needs. To do this information we will need to refresh are geography skills and gather weather data from around the world. The analysis will include compiling the information/data, initial analysis and models/graphs and final models/maps. After reviewing the inital prokect you have been tasked with adding weather preferences so that customers/beta testers can use choose their preferred vacation local and plan an itinerary based on this.

## Results

### Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map
The results of analysis revealed that on a weekly basis between January 2019 and the end of April 2019 urban cities made the most fares. Urban cities were always above $1,500. Whereas Suburban cities stayed between $500 and $1,500  and rural cities stayed under $500. Meaning that urban cities earn at least three times the amount of fares in the same time period as rural cities. This can be see in greater detail in the graph below.

## Summary
Based on the results, the following recommendations are made to solve disparities:

1. Try to increase both riders and drivers in suburban cities.
2. Reduce the number of drivers in urban areas to try to increase the Average Fare per Driver for urban cities.
3. Increase the number of drivers in rural cities If the drivers didn't have to travel as far or the customers have to wait so long, maybe there would be higher utilization.
