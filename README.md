# Plan My Trip with Python APIs

## Overview of Project
The head of the user interface team (Jack) at Plan My Trip, a hotel travel website has asked company XYZ for help in creating a search page that uses filter criteria to determine the customers' needs. To do this information we will need to refresh are geography skills and gather weather data from around the world. The analysis will include compiling the information/data, initial analysis and models/graphs and final models/maps. After reviewing the initial project, you have been tasked with adding weather preferences so that customers/beta testers can use choose their preferred vacation local and plan an itinerary based on this.

## Results
Anybody who has ever traveled knows the power of a map. _Dora, the Explorer_ even had a song about it. The maps created in this challenge exemplify just how powerful maps can be.

### Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map
This map shows the cities that meet the temperature requirements entered by the customer. hen clicked on it also gives detailed information such as the City, Country Code, Weather Description and Maximum Temperature. In our case the customer entered a 'minimum temperature' of 73 and a 'maximum temperature' of 85.

### Create a Travel Itinerary Map
Several different types of maps can be used for data itineraries.

#### WeatherPy Travel Map
This map literally takes you from 'Point A' to 'Point B'. It plots out the itinerary for your trip so that you can see what it looks like. The map below shows driving, bicycling or walking.

#### WeatherPy travel map markers
This map only shows the four map markers for the four cities in Australia that we chose. When clicked on it also gives detailed information such as the City, Country Code, Weather Description and Maximum Temperature.

## Summary
GMAPS is a great tool API tool for mapping. As someone who went to school to be a social studies teacher and loves maps, I was super excited to do this module. My excitement turned to frustration when the pip installs needed for this module would not install for me. I spent hours researching, working with the TAs, and professor on this. I finally found something on google that  worked and it let me get gmaps. This slowed me down greatly and took more time than the actual challenge. I think this challenge was a good exercise of our skills as it challenged us and taught us how to use them in a different way.
